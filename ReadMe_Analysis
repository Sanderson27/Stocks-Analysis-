#VBA_Challenge
  ## Using VBA to compare multiple stock prices and their changes through years 2017 and 2018
    The main result we learned is that across the board of the stock tockers analyzed, 2018 was a much better
    year for returns. We see almost all positve returns in 2017 and almost all negative in 2018.
    
    By refactoring the code we were able to shave a little bit off of the run time of the macros for the 
    given year. 
    This is not enough data for that to matter at all as both run times were very quick.
    If however the data set was to be grown much lager you could benefit from this. 
    It also becomes a bit more straight forward in reading what the macro is doing.
    
    Shorter run times particularly when dealing with very large amounts of data as well as 
    easier ability to understand and debug are potential benefits of refactoring your macro.
    Potential downsides could be that your macro is actually more difficult for the original writer
    as well as someone new looking at the data. As well as the time spent doing so. 
    If t=you spend a lot of time refactoring it just to save fractions of seconds that is not likely worth while
    You also run the risk of creating new errors and bugs that again take time to fix when you already 
    had a working macro.
